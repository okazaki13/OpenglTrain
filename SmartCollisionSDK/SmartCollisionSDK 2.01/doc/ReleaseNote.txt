History of release

2007/01/12 Ver2.01
  (1)Problem about memory leak in a certain situation has been modified.
  (2)Validation check of triangle data for SCObject::AddTriangle are modified.
     Topological and geometrical degeneration check of triangle has been added.
  (3)libEasyDevice has been modified. In new implementation,callback function 
     for collision is called by using TIME_ONESHOT.

2006/11/30 Release candidate of Ver2.01
  (1)USB protection library is updated.
  (2)Problem about updating penetration depth computation without intersection
     has been fixed.
  (3)Precision of creation of BVHs has been improved, still more.
  (4)Problem about initialization between active object and sleeping object has
     been fixed.
  (4)The algorithm of penetration depth computation has been improved. New algorithm
     is more efficient and robust.

  (1)Optimization for penetration depth computation between convex polyhedra
     has been added.
  (2)HelloSmartCollisin has been modified.
  (3)libEasyDevice has been modified.
  (4)Inappropriate initialization of penetration depth computation has been 
     fixed.

2006/08/23 Release of Ver2.00 beta 0.2
  (1)SCSceneManager::SetActivitiyGroupPair was modified. 
     Behavior of SC_ACTIVITY_ACTIVE was changed. 
     SC_ACTIVITY_ONE_WAY_ACTIVE and SC_ACTIVITY_ONE_WAY_INACTIVE were added.

2006/08/21 Release of Ver2.00 beta 0.1
  (1)SCSceneManager::SetActivitiyGroupPair was modified. 
     Behavior of SC_ACTIVITY_ACTIVE was changed. 
     SC_ACTIVITY_ONE_WAY_ACTIVE and SC_ACTIVITY_ONE_WAY_INACTIVE were added.

2006/08/07 Release of Ver2.00 beta
  Changes from previous version are as follows.
  (1)Support of multiple groups. Previous version supports only two groups(The
     group of controllded objcts and the group of static objects).
  (2)Support of bi-directional penetration depth computation.
  (3)Support of flexible control of group pairs, between which collision 
     detections perform,by using activity state of groups and pairs of groups.
  (4)The following types of SCSceneManager::SetAttributeEnum were added.
     SC_SCENE_MANAGER_PENETRATION_DEPTH_COMPUTATION
  (5)The following types of SCSceneManager::GetStatus were added.
     SC_CONTACT_NORMAL
  (6)The following types of SCSceneManager::GetStatus were added as the aliases.
     SC_POINT_ON_TARGET(for SC_POINT_ON_CONTROLLED_OBJECT)
     SC_POINT_ON_OPPONENT(for SC_POINT_ON_STATIC_OBJECT)
     SC_TARGET_OBJECT_ID(for SC_CONTROLLED_OBJECT_ID)
     SC_OPPONENT_OBJECT_ID(for SC_STATIC_OBJECT_ID)
  (7)SmartCollisionMultipleGroupTest are added as a sample program.

2006/04/04 Release of Ver1.03
  Changes from previous version are as follows.
  (1)The following types of SCSceneManager::GetStatus were added.
     SC_CONTACT_POSITION,SC_CONTACT_ORIENTATION
     SC_CONTACT_TRANSFORMATION_MATRIX

2006/03/16 Release of Ver1.02
  Changes from previous version are as follows.
  (1)The result of GetTransformation(SC_POSITION_LOCAL_CENTER,...)of SCObject
     was changed.

2005/02/16 Release of Ver1.01
  Changes from previous version are as follows.
  (1)There is no changes in the definition of API specification.
  (2)The return values of SC_STATIC_OBJECT_ID and SC_CONTROLLED_OBJECT_ID 
     were changed.
     In Ver. 1.0, the return value is the index value of the object. 
     In Ver. 1.01, the return value is the ID of the object.
  (3)The example program SmartCollisionTest.cpp was changed for (2).
  (4)The example program HelloSmartCollision.cpp was changed to detect 
     invalid license.

2005/11/16 Release of Ver1.0
